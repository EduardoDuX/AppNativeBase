# App made for a task i had in Mobile Programming class

To run the app you can use it in expo, or try it out in [snack](https://snack.expo.io/@eduardux/trabalho-pdm)

The idea is that it would be an app for my school, it doesn't have a database nor can it connect to the interent, therefore it has a bunch of simplifications and is not even remotly close to something functional(yes i'm well aware of that).
